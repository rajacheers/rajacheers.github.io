## Advice given to others

- I think that summary is -> diversification preserves wealth, concentration creates wealth. So diversify using a good portfolio (stocks, bonds, real assets, cash across geographies). But do take risks with a small amount.
First common problem is , People ignore  inflation bonds + developed markets + gold + agriculture + real estate in general during diversification.
- Second  is people don't know how to take risks or they never do.
- Third problem is not rebalancing regularly and at the right times.
